# Credit Card Fraud Detection - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project focuses on exploring and analyzing a dataset to detect fraudulent transactions in credit card operations. Using data science and machine learning techniques, the goal is to uncover patterns and insights that differentiate fraudulent activities from legitimate ones.

## Project Overview

Credit card fraud poses significant challenges to financial institutions and customers alike. This project aims to analyze a dataset of transactions to identify fraudulent activities through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Insights gained here can form the foundation for developing machine learning models to detect fraud more effectively.

## Steps Involved

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing or corrupted values.
   - Scaling features (if necessary).
   - Splitting data into training and testing subsets.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualizing the distribution of transaction amounts and times.
   - Analyzing correlations between features.
   - Identifying patterns in fraudulent transactions.
   - Plotting heatmaps, box plots, and histograms for better insights.

3. **Class Imbalance Handling**:
   - Highlighting the severe class imbalance in the dataset.
   - Discussing methods to address this imbalance (e.g., oversampling, undersampling).

4. **Feature Importance**:
   - Identifying features that significantly impact fraudulent activities.
